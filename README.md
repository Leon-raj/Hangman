This is my first project learning to code as a teenager.
I'll first add the basic elements and logic of the game based on what I know.
I'll then add some hangman graphics using some library modules.
I might add a few more features along the way.

This project is purely indented for my own learning, so if you have any suggestions on how I can code better or be more efficient please let me know, and feel free to point out my mistakes.

Thank you.
